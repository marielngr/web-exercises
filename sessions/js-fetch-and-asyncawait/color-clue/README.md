# Fetch with random color clue

To be clear: Fetching data can be frightening at the beginning. But don't worry, we are going to make you familiar with the syntax and it will be fine ;)

## Task

Finish this small Quiz game. The only thing that is left is the fetch to the color api:

https://www.thecolorapi.com/id?hex=<your color code>

Write all code in the fetchNewColor() function.

1. Use the autogenerated hexCode to fetch the information to this color from the api. Inspect the incoming json with a console log!

2. In the received data, find the hex value and the color name. Update the variable 'colorObject' with the respective data.

3. Update the textContent of the `nameDisplay` with the name stored in the colorObject.

Please switch to the [index.js](js/index.js) file to start counting!
