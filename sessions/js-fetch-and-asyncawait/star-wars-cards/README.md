# Fetch with Star Wars Cards

To be clear: Fetching data can be frightening at the beginning. But don't worry, we are going to make you familiar with the syntax and it will be fine ;)

## Task

Till now we only have information about one character from Star Wars. Lets get more data and create new cards from them!

1.: Fetch more data from the Star Wars Api:

https://swapi.dev/api/people

Use the .then notation to receive the response and request the data with the .json() method. Use a console.log to look at the received data!

2.: Use an array method to create and render a card for each object in the fetched data array.

HINT: You can use the functions `createCharacterCard` and `renderElement` to create those cards, see above for an example!

Please switch to the [index.js](js/index.js) file to start counting!
