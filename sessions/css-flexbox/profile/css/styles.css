/* Exercise 2: The tech stack list needs to be polished! Arrange the list items with flexbox according to the following criteria:

- Each list item should be as wide as its characters plus the padding.
- The space before, after and between the list items should be the same.
- If the width is to small to contain all list items in one row, they should wrap to the next line.
- There should always be a horizontal and vertical gap of 10px between each list item.
