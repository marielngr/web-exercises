/* Exercise: We have a navigation with some links that look like buttons as part of a header. Now we want to arrange the links with flexbox to achieve a more responsive layout of the menu. The following criteria should be met:

- The links are horizontally spaced as far apart as possible.
- The first link is placed at the beginning and the last link at the end.
- If you reduce the width of the viewport, then the links wrap to the next line when the space becomes too small.
- There should be a minimum vertical and horizontal gap of about 10 px between the links.

Hint: Look carefully which element should be the flexbox container.
