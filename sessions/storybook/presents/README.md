# Storybook: Presents

<!--

Describe the exercise in a few sentences. E.g.:

This challenge offers a simple form with three input fields. Let's make it interactive using React!

-->

## Task

### Alert

There is a simple [`Alert component`](./components/Alert/index.js). Write stories for different alerts:

- a default story without any passed props
- some variants with different `text` and `color` props

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- Create a file `components/Alert/Alert.stories.js`.
- Import the `Alert` component.
- Create a default export which contains an object with a title and the component.
- Write the story functions and return the `Alert` component with different props.
  - Make sure to export the functions.

Start Storybook with `npm run storybook` and check your first stories!

### Card

There is a [`Card component`](./components/Card/index.js) which receives some props.
Write at least two stories for the Card component. Use the `args` object to pass the props; change some props for the second, third etc. story using the `args` object.

You can use the following hints as guideline:

- For each story, create a copy of the given Template with `Template.bind({})`.
- Set the `args` object for the default story.
- Set the `args` object for every following story by spreading the default `args` object and change the desired values.

Explaining the task in detail. E.g.:
